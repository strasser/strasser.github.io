Includes management of grants in the DDD InitiativeÕs portfolio; planning and overseeing grantee meetings, collaborations and partnerships; partnering with grantees and creating linkages that add value to the field; and tracking trends and synthesizing knowledge relevant to the initiative issue areas. Separate from the DDD Initiative, I source and develop grants related to improving how science is conducted, including projects focused on data management,  scholarly communication, and synthesis studies.

### 2011 - 2015: University of California's [California Digital Library](http://cdlib.org)

  **Research Data Specialist**. Operated as a researcher liaison by providing guidance and consultation about data stewardship to UC researchers; lead workshops and give seminars on the value of data management for scientists; promote open science and open data within the UC and beyond. [Dash](http://cdluc3.github.io/dash) data curation platform product manager; [DMPTool](http://dmptool.org) project team member. Supervisor, CLIR/DLF Postdoctoral fellow in data curation. Communications and outreach coordinator: maintained blog and social media accounts. Briefly seconded by [DataCite](http://datacite.org) to serve as Manager of Strategic Partnerships.

### 2010 - 2011: [DataONE](http://dataone.org)

  **Postdoctoral Associate** based at National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis. Engaged the scientific and data management community in the Data Observation Network for Earth (DataONE), which is cyber-infrastructure that will provide universal access to environmental and ecological data. Included conducting research related to data education, workshop organization, and participation in working groups to engage the community. 

### 2009 - 2010: University of Alberta & Dalhousie University
