_Director of Alliances and Data Strategy_. Develop partnerships with academic and non-profit research organizations in support of Hutch Data Commonwealth initiatives, especially as they relate to data-driven research. Connect Fred Hutch researchers working in bioinformatics and data science and explore collaborative opportunities that will benefit scientific goals of the institution.

### December 2017 - June 2018: [Collaborative Knowledge Foundation (Coko)](http://coko.foundation)

_Director of Strategic Development_. Established and manageed the development of the [Coko](http://coko.foundation) community program across all publishing products and services. Worked with marketing team, developers, and product managers to effectively communicate Coko's mission of creating open source infrastructure for research communication. Coordinated meetings, wrote grant proposals, and produced external-facing information about Coko's book and journal publishing platforms.


### 2015 - 2017: [Gordon & Betty Moore Foundation](http://www.moore.org)

_Program Officer_, [Data-Driven Discovery Initiative](http://www.moore.org/programs/science/data-driven-discovery). Contributed to strategy development, implementation, and management of the Initiative. Managed grants in the Initiative's portfolio; planned and oversaw grantee meetings, collaborations and partnerships; and tracked trends, synthesizing knowledge relevant to the initiative. Separate from the Initiative, sourced and developed grants related to improving how science is conducted, including projects focused on data management,  scholarly communication, and synthesis studies. Led the Foundation in establishing an [Open Access policy](https://www.moore.org/article-detail?newsUrlName=moore-foundation-rolls-out-new-open-access-policy) for all grantees.


### 2011 - 2015: University of California's [California Digital Library](http://cdlib.org)
